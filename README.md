## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```

2. Import the database schema from `xplaypal.sql` file.

3. Update the database connection details in `xconfig.php`.

4. Start the PHP server:

   Alternatively, **use XAMPP** and paste the main folder in `htdocs`. Turn on **Apache** & **phpmyadmin** servers and import the database schema at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/` (I used it).

5. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8000` (or whatever your port is).
